# sdl-func-drawer
C-written program to visualize random math functions. 

Inspired by a piece of code I wrote 3 years ago as a part of university computational math course just because unlike my new groupmates I didn't know Java and JavaFX, therefore SDL1.2 was the only way to visualize I knew ([example at the end](https://github.com/dimaglushkov/itmo-se-reports/blob/main/2-1/computational-math/%D0%92%D0%9C-%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%B1-3.pdf)) and that was a lot of struggle back then. 

Unfortunately, the original code quality was dramatically low, so I decided to write it again.

Below you can find a few examples of what this visualization looks like.

Not sure if this thing is even usefull, but I had a lot of fun developing it :)
